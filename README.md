*Note: This analysis is based on publicly available job postings and company communications as of August 2025. Actual internal technologies and strategies may vary.*

* Workday was originally intended to be deployed "just like PeopleSoft" but made a pivot to multi-tenancy in their own data centers before initial release. Now, they still operate their own purpose-built data centers, deploy on AWS and GCP, with Adaptive Planning also deployed on Azure.
